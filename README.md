```

* `classes/` main classes used in the project, in hierarchical order:
  * `myplots.py` functions for plotting data and results, with preset styles for consistency.
  * `collectdata.py` collects, processes and organize data from the xlsx raw files.
  * `subset.py` data subset delimited by user-defined first and last eruptions. Contains data (volume and dates) 
as well as period's limits for eacy access (first/last eruption id, dates, volume), stats, timelines and prediction methods.
Official periods are identified by a positive 'label' attribute, while unofficial periods are identified by a negative 'label' attribute.
  * `eruption.py` contains the `Eruption` class, which is used to represent each volcanic eruption and its properties; used by other classes to pass and retrieve information about a single eruption
  * `basicfun.py` basic functions used across the project (e.g. computing of stats and error, data transformation functions).

* `scripts/` contains the scripts that generate the plots and perform data analysis.
  * `historical_data.py`: generates plots using historical data collected and processed by `VolcanoData` class. 
  * `prediction_data.py`: generates plots for all three prediction methods.
Choose which volcano to plot by setting the `volcano_id` on top of the script.
* `tests/` contains unit tests scripts for the classes.
* `plots/` output plots generated by the scripts will be saved here
* `rawdata/` place raw data files used in the project in this folder.
